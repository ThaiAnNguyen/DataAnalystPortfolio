## International Football Tournaments Project
Welcome to the International Football Tournaments project! This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of international football tournaments to gain insights and [visualize key findings](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chon.thai.an.nguyen/viz/InternationalFootballTournamentsDashboard/Dashboard1?publish=yes).

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?select=shootouts.csv). It contains comprehensive information about international football results from 1872 to 2023, including match results, goalscorers, and penalty shootout details. The dataset is available in the file named `result.csv`.

Please note that the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download it directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?select=shootouts.csv). In addition, the dataset may have been updated since the completion of this project. Please ensure you are using the most recent version of the dataset for accurate analysis and results.

### SQL Queries
The `International Football Tournaments Project - SQL Queries.sql` file in this repository contains a set of queries that can be executed to perform various analyses on the football dataset. These queries cover aspects such as team performance, tournament statistics, home team win rate and goalscoring trend over time. 

I use SSMS for SQL queries but you can run these queries on your preferred SQL database management system.

### Tableau Visualization
The `International Football Tournaments Project - Tableau Connections.sql` file provides the necessary SQL code to establish a connection between the football dataset and Tableau. By using this code, you can connect Tableau to your SQL database and leverage the dataset for interactive visualizations.

Additionally, you can explore the interactive Tableau visualization of the International Football Tournaments project by visiting the Tableau Public page [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chon.thai.an.nguyen/viz/InternationalFootballTournamentsDashboard/Dashboard1?publish=yes). The image below provides a preview of the visualization:

Please note that this Tableau Visualization focus on popular tournaments and may not represent the entire dataset. The visualizations are designed to facilitate exploration and analysis of the selected tournaments. They allow users to interact with the data, filter specific time periods and tournaments, compare team performance, and gain insights into various aspects of the tournaments.
