## Data Analyst Portfolio
Welcome to my data analyst portfolio! This repository contains three projects focusing on different aspects of data science: Web Scraping, Car Price Prediction, and Tableau Visualization.

### Project 1: Python Web Scraping
The Web Scraping project focuses on extracting data from websites using Python and BeautifulSoup library. It includes two Jupyter Notebook files and their corresponding output CSV files:

`All-time_EPL_Table_Scraping.ipynb`: This notebook scrapes the all-time English Premier League (EPL) table from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup and requests. The scraped data is cleaned and saved as `All-time_EPL_Table.csv`.

`VN_International_Debt_Statistics_Scraping.ipynb`: This notebook scrapes Vietnam's international debt statistics from The World Bank website using BeautifulSoup and requests. The extracted data is cleaned and saved as `VN_International_Debt_Statistics.csv`.

Please refer to the individual project directories for more detailed information on each web scraping project.

### Project 2: Vietnamese Car Price Prediction
The Car Price Prediction project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning algorithms. It includes a cleaned dataset and a Jupyter Notebook file named `Car Price Prediction.ipynb` that demonstrates the complete workflow:

- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
- Encoding categorical values using target encoding.
- Testing and evaluating three regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest.
- Selecting the best-performing model (Random Forest) and creating an interface for real-time price prediction using widgets and IPython.

Please refer to the project directory for more detailed information on the Car Price Prediction project.

### Project 3: International Football Tournaments
The International Football Tournaments Project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from popular football tournaments. It includes SQL queries to extract insights and build relational database as well as interactive visualizations created using Tableau, showcasing team performance, tournament statistics, home team win rate and goal-scoring trend over time. Please note that the visualizations included in this project only reflect popular tournaments and not the entire dataset. The dataset URL and more information can be found in the project directory.

Please refer to the respective project directories for more detailed information on each project, including specific requirements, dependencies, and usage instructions.

## How to Run the Projects
Each project is organized in its respective directory with detailed instructions on how to run the code and reproduce the results. Please refer to the README file within each project directory for specific guidance.
